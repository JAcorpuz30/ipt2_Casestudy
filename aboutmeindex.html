        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Maria Yzabella Ghryz Arellano, a 21-year-old from Pura, Tarlac. Ever since I was young, my biggest dream has been to complete my education. This goal is deeply personal to me, as I want to use my education as a way to uplift not only myself but also my family. My parents have always worked hard to provide for me, and finishing my studies will allow me to give back to them in meaningful ways. I aspire to create opportunities that can make a real difference in our lives and to show them that their sacrifices were worth it. My motivation comes from the desire to build a better future for us all, and I believe education is the key to making this dream a reality.</p>
